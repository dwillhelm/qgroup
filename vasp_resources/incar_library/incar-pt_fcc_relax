# Electronic Relaxation:
 ENCUT = 400 # sets PW cutoff (eV)
 PREC = normal # default, NGX=1.5Gcut, NGXF=2NGX
 EDIFF = 1E-04 # energy-stopping criterion for

# electronic minimization (eV)
 ALGO = Fast # 5 initial steps of blocked Davidson followed by RMM-DIIS algorithms

# DOS related values:
 ISMEAR = 1 # smearing by Methfessel/Paxton

# method for metals
 SIGMA = 0.10 # broadening parameter (eV)
 # ISPIN = 2 # spin-polarization switched off

# Ionic Relaxation:
 NSW = 100 # max number of steps for structural relaxation
 IBRION = 1 # ionic relaxation using quasi-Newton method
 EDIFFG = -0.02 # stopping criterion by force on atoms (eV/A)
 ISIF = 1 # moves ions at fixed shape and volume of lattice, calculate forces only
 ISYM = 0 # no symmetry, 2 (on) is default for PAW
 POTIM = 0.2 # scaling constant for the forces
